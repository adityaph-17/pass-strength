# Password Strength Checker Web Application

## 📌 Project Overview
The Password Strength Checker is a web-based application that evaluates the strength of a user-entered password and provides feedback and suggestions to improve security. The project is developed as a **Micro Project for Software Engineering (MSBTE – K Scheme)**.

The application helps users understand how strong or weak their passwords are and creates awareness about common password security practices.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The password is evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Minimum length (8 characters)
- Presence of uppercase letters
- Presence of lowercase letters
- Presence of numbers
